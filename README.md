# openPDC-Pi3
This repository contains work in progress and final documentation for installing and operating the Grid Protection Alliance openPDC on the Raspberry Pi 3 Model B.

The intent of this repository is to provide others with a preview of the documentation prior to merging it with the production openPDC project.

Your feedback, suggestions, and contributions are welcome!
